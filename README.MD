# The Local Library

Have you ever thought of how collections are stored by computers. Yeah ðŸ¤“, computers just work exactly how you've thought. 

They store them a record just like a library. The problem is that we have to store these collections/records in a distinct way so that we can refer, retrieve and remember them. Just how the local bank works ðŸ˜„. 

That's what this project does, we store the book you enter into our record and display the records.
